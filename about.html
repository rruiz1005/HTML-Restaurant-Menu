            Chef Ruiz started his culinary journey when he moved to New Jersey, where he was able to experience a plethora of different cuisines due to the diversity of the community.
            Learning everything he could about different spices used in different dishes, and making friends along the way.
            Chef Ryan was able to create his own set of original meals that he would sell around the community.
            Eventually he was able to raise enough money to open his flagship location in Hoboken, NJ and from then on he's seen only succes in his culinary endevours.
